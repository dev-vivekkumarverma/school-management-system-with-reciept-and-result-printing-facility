### school-management-system-with-reciept-and-result-printing-facility

It is a school management desktop app I build for my school when i just started coding in python.
# It is totaly based on python, frontend used Tkinter and sqlite for database.

## It enables you to manage all the records and events of a school and can print the payment receipt and also the result on the printer if connected to it and can save it as pdf otherwise.
